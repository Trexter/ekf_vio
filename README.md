## Monocular EKF Visual Inertial Odometry.
Developed by Kevin Sheridan, Purdue University.

# Summary
This program is a traditional monocular EKF SLAM implementation. Currently it works but runs slowly and is inaccurate. I decided to store my work in this repository to potentially work on it later beacause I think it has good potential.
